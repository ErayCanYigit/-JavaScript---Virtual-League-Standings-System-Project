Virtual League Standings System
Welcome to the Virtual League Standings System project! This project is a Node.js application designed to manage and display the standings of a virtual sports league. It allows users to manually input match results or read them from a file, and then processes these results to update the league standings accordingly.

Features
Team Statistics Management: Keeps track of various statistics for each team, including matches played, wins, draws, losses, goals scored, goals conceded, and points.
Match Result Processing: Ensures the validity of match results, preventing duplicate entries and invalid team codes.
Dynamic Standings Display: Displays the league standings based on different sorting methods (points, alphabetical order, or team nickname) and allows for uppercase display customization.
File Input Support: Reads match results from a specified text file for batch processing.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a simple menu-driven interface for users to interact with the system.
How to Use
Enter Match Results Manually: Input match results directly through the command line interface.
Read Match Results from File: Specify a text file containing match results to be processed.
View Standings: Display the current league standings with customizable sorting and display options.
Exit: Exit the application.
