# -JavaScript---Virtual-League-Standings-System-Project
Welcome to the Virtual League Standings System project! This project is a Node.js application designed to manage and display the standings of a virtual sports league. It allows users to manually input match results or read them from a file, and then processes these results to update the league standings accordingly.
